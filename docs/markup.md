### Mark-Up used

"id":0, "pitch" : 41.2, "duration": 0.5, "rate": 1, "volume": 0.5

Id - an identifier derived from the count of the note (so the first is 0, second is 1). Starting from 0 is machine based but it is intended to be used with Web Audio or similar timing systems. 

Pitch - the frequency of the note using hertz. This is used by Web Audio as tthe frequency. 

Duration - How long the note should last. Acts in seconds but is based on the timings that Steele puts in as either duple or triple time. 

Rate - The speed that the note should be given. SSML uses this to speed up vocalisation. 

Volume - The volume, or gain in Web Audio, of the note.
